# SpeedrunSilentPatch

(WIP) This is where you will find the GTA Community's version of [SilentPatch](https://cookieplmonster.github.io/mods/gta/)! 

If you're not familiar with [SilentPatch](https://cookieplmonster.github.io/mods/gta/), basically it fixes a bunch of issues with the 3D GTA Trilogy. This is great for casual players, but it fixes too much to be viable for speedrunning. Some fixes make SP straight-up faster than vanilla, meaning everyone would need to use it to be competitive.

The idea of SpeedrunSilentPatch (SSP) is to create a fork of [SilentPatch](https://cookieplmonster.github.io/mods/gta/) that fixes issues and adds QoL features, but does not create any time-based advantage for speedruns. This means it is completely optional for veterans, while at the same time lowering the barrier to entry for those new to our community.

A proposed list of changes are below. Ones marked with a ? or ones I'm currently unsure about.
